<h2>Rubiks Based Encryption</h2>
<p>This is an old highschool project that I probably won't touch anymore, unless I get way too high.</p>
<p>Relatively simple concept, the idea behind these (other than messing around in esolangs) was to translate ascii onto a Rubik's cube, utilizing Rubik's notation <a href="https://jperm.net/3x3/moves">(found here)</a> as the encryption, with initial permutation as a salt.</p>
<p>Possible future updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using unicode rather than ASCII</li>
  <li>Fancy fancy math to obfuscate input</li>
  <li>Adding more puzzles
    <ul>
      <li>4x4</li>
      <li>5x5</li>
      <li>Minx family</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Show encrypted message on generated cube</li>
  <li>Completely remake the encryption, to allow decryption</li>
  <li>Moar languages! ALL THE LANGUAGES!</li>
</ul>
